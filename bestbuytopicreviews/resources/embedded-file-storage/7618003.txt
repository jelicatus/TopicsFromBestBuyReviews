({:comment "I've been using Apple products since the begging and they only get better. Ease of use is my priority and they never fail in that department. I would unflinchingly recommend any Apple product including the iPhone 6."} {:comment "This phone is great! The color of the phone is beautiful!"} {:comment "Bought this for my daughter She is a die hard Apple Fan and Loves it ..."} {:comment "The IPHONE 6 is a great buy! It has so many cool features that the previous ones did. Worth Every dollar."} {:comment "Not much has changed since the last iPhone. All they did was add a few gadgets and make it bigger. Wondering why they still won't let us change the theme completely like the Androids. Would recommend because of its retina display."} {:comment "easy to use, bug free, love how it integrates with my laptop"} {:comment "I needed a new phone, and this one is doing ok. Normally not an iPhone guy, but I got a good deal on it."} {:comment "The iPhone 6 is the perfect size. After using that size phone, the screens on the iPhone 5 series now seem so small. Yet the 6 isn't too big. And its sleek design makes it seems smaller than it is.\n\nAs far as overall quality and features, nothing beats the iPhone. There are times when the greater flexibility of Android phones (such as the ease in setting an MP3 file as the ring tone), and their standard Micro USB ports, are nice. But there are many other times when an Android phone just can't compete with the iPhone. In particular, many Android apps \"control\" your phone and do things behind the scenes. Apple has seen to it that iPhone apps are much less intrusive and are easier to control. Apple iOS is great. And the sound and screen quality of the iPhone also are amazing.\n\nJust as it is with Apple personal computers, Apple quality and superior operating systems come at a price. But if you can afford them, nothing beats them."} {:comment "This has so many new features than my old iPhone! I love the finger print scan instead of entering your 4 digit code, better camera, faster service, and it is all around perfect!!!!"} {:comment "I bought this for my wife because she really prefers the Apple ecosystem. As much as it pains me to say it, it is a good quality product overall. We have had a little trouble with the mic for the speakerphone (which means Siri no longer hears her) but have not had a chance to take it anywhere to have it looked at."} {:comment "Been using Samsung products the last several years. I am happy thus far with the ease of use with the iPhone."} {:comment "This was a great deal on the Iphone 6 for $99......."} {:comment "Got this for my teenager and he loves it! He like i\"Stuff\" though and I'm not a huge fan. Might be after my latest phone, the dreaded LG3..."} {:comment "The iPhone 6 is sleek lightweight great screen very easy to use"} {:comment "This is the best iPhone yet. It's thinner, lighter and has a nice big screen."} {:comment "I'm pretty new to apple, so this is my first review in any apple product. I'm impressed with everything from the features to battery life. I wish I had gone the apple route sooner."} {:comment "Love the size of the Iphone 6.....also like that the home button is on the side of the phone instead of the top."} {:comment "We upgrading from I phone 4S. MUCH better camera, still easy to use."} {:comment "This phone does everything you could want a phone to do. If you are looking for an upgrade, I would strongly consider purchasing this phone."} {:comment "I would recommend saving some money and getting the 64 gb model, but this a great phone."} {:comment "This is a very good phone, it is much better than my old iphone 4s, the phone is very fast and I love the fingerprint lock feature!"} {:comment "This is by fr the best phone I have owned. It is very slik, fast and great deaign overall."} {:comment "an excellent phone all the way, if only i had the 32GB, it would have been better. as you gobble up storage space quickly with apps and pics, not to mention the IOS9 upgrade coming soon which will set you back 1GB+ of the storage you now have....get the 32GB for sure."} {:comment "Great phone. Battery life is exceptional; display is sharp. Camera takes great pictures."} {:comment "We upgraded my dad's line and chose the Iphone 6. He had previously had an Iphone 4. Moving my dad into the communication age has been a tedious task to say the least. He has come along kicking and screaming. He purchased his very first computer in 2010. I am still not convinced that he knows the difference between the hard drive and the internet. However, Apple has helped us make this transition with little or no pain with phones. There were enough positive changes to the 6 to peak his interest yet it was not complex enough to scare him away. Good job Apple!"} {:comment "The iPhone 6 is a great iPhone, featuring a larger screen and better camera. This is a fantastic phone."} {:comment "i love this phone! the bigger display is more crisp and colorful than my 5s. I have pretty good battery life too but I think that's more because the phone is new and not because the battery is better. We will see how it holds up over time. I am not a fan of the size but thats only because my hands are so small. Still an awesome phone."} {:comment "for and open box item and getting $200 gift certificate its a no brainier compared to a new one and paying $200"} {:comment "Great phone. Easy to use. Sprint service not the best however."} {:comment "Had this phone for 6 months now. Great quality and price!"} {:comment "The phone doesn't need any introduction. Name says it all. Has been working perfect since the day I bought it for my wife. I have also been using an iPhone 6 when it came out and absolutely had no problem what so ever. My wife had been using an Android phone for many years and this is her first iPhone and she loves it."} {:comment "What can you say, it's an Apple Iphone! Works great, good improvement."} {:comment "Great phone! Best iPhone yet. would recommend this phone."} {:comment "These features on the phone are way better the then before I upgraded from a 4 so just imagine how I feel..."} {:comment "Larger screen makes apps easier to read and use. Still light weight not too bulky."} {:comment "I have had every model of iPhone since it was first released, and this one does not disappoint! From the stellar camera, to the crisp and colorful screen, and the overall fit and finish of the phone, I am beyond impressed. My only concern is how Apple will top the iPhone 6!"} {:comment "I thought transitioning to an iPhone from a droid would suck, but this has been great!"} {:comment "Bigger screen, better sound, fingerprint password, love it!!!!"} {:comment "Apple continues to set the bar for wireless communication devices. The new features I.e. Apple pay is great! The new screen bigger size is \"just right\"."} {:comment "Larger screen nothing all that more spectacular since the 4s, but I'm satisfied"} {:comment "It was an iPhone purchase purchased online and picked up at store"} {:comment "We had a few minor issues at first, but once Apple last update/ fix everything is great."} {:comment "I have had an i-phone ever since it was introduced.

He had issues with poor internet access and found out it was due to it not being 4g. He works in a manufacturing plant and coverage in there was not good. Once he got this 6, he is now able to enjoy the benefits of the 4g LTE capabilities and is very satisfied."} {:comment "Phone works fine.son enjoys it talks all the time on it"} {:comment "The graphics are beautiful and crystal clear.\nThe screen size is so much better."} {:comment "I absolutely love my new iPhone! Love the features: Siri, voice texting, double tap home button, etc. there's nothing like an iPhone."} {:comment "Screen size is better than last year's model. Battery life is still weak little under 10 hours. Also wish all apps could be zoomed out."} {:comment "Anyone and everyone must have one. Best iPhone ever!!!!"} {:comment "Great item, except it's battery.

Really light and the battery lasts a long time. Definitely worth the money!"} {:comment "So far I like this Iphone and enjoying all the nice features."} {:comment "Although the features are very user friendly, I find it to be very cumbersome. If you are not built like a toothpick, it doesn't sit on your belt comfortably!"} {:comment "I went from a Galaxy S4 to this iphone only because I lost my Galaxy. This phone seemed pretty slow, right out the box with no added apps. I was told this was due to Sprint having a slow network. Even WiFi seemed to lack speed. I am not an iphone Hater, I still have a 4 that I use. It is only a little slower than the 6. I returned the phone after 5 days use. two months ago. Still have not seen a credit from Sprint. I have heard that it works great on other networks...I bought another S4."} {:comment "I upgraded my dad's iPhone for Christmas from a 4s and this is definitely the best iPhone yet. Great camera, perfect size. Im not one to upgrade every iPhone release, but from the 5 i have, ill be upgrading soon myself."} {:comment "Very happy with the new iPhone 6. I am very impressed with the screen, somehow it doesn't show fingerprints and almost seems like it is Teflon coated."} {:comment "I really like my IPhone 6. . Much larger screen than my 4, yet fits in my back pocket! Many new features not previously afforded me. Sleek and stylish, but not too big. In a word - AWESOME!!"} {:comment "This the best iPhone yet. Great camera. And the slo-mo is sick."} {:comment "One of the best one, I got for my self and my daughter for Christmas and we love it. perfect size, camera, for video chat."} {:comment "I've had my new phone for more than a month. However, I still haven't learned how to use it. I understand from several friends and advisors that I can download information (such as my contacts) from MacBook Pro to the I-phone. I plan to do that as soon as it gets a little warmer. I have a feeling I will love the device once I learn how to use it."} {:comment "Nice sleek phone with a great camera and fast sprint lte service"} {:comment "Love this phone! Charges fast and holds the charge longer!"} {:comment "Love it!!! I had the 4 S and it was so much slower."} {:comment "Had to go to two different stores to get the GB I wanted.

So glad I waited to upgrade my phone."} {:comment "Thanks to Apple for going with a bigger screen. The picture is outstanding and very clear."} {:comment "Love my iPhone. Right size and weight. Protective accessories available."} {:comment "The iPhone is a good phone but personally I liked the size of the iPhone 5 better phones keep getting bigger and bigger personally I would use one of the three tablets I own if I want a bigger screen. The phone has great apps because IOS has great apps but everything is controlled by Apple such as storage which with the 15 Gb is a joke because of the size of IOS 8."} {:comment "I was concerned about upgrading my iphone because I thought it would be too big but it has surprised me by how light it is an the screen size is better than previous versions."} {:comment "great product, glad I bought the product for family"} {:comment "It's nice phone just don't like volume issues how you can turn down"} {:comment "My kid loves his new I phone.

The plus was to big for my girlie hands."} {:comment "Replaced my iPhone 4S with the iPhone 6 and it has exceeded all expectations.

Highly recommend."} {:comment "The service and the knowledge of the associate was terrific."} {:comment "Love the improved size of the screen and thin frame."} {:comment "The phone is excellent (as always) - just what you'd expect from Apple; the transition was smooth - it got everything it needed from iCloud automagically...liked the iPhone 5 size better but I guess everyone else prefers bigger phones these days."} {:comment "nice size phone not. To big or small,functions perfectly no complaints"} {:comment "I love this phone. All the usual fun features of an IPhone but with a bigger screen.
