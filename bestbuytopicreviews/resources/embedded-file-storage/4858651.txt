However the connecting wire on the adapter is very thin and can cause the adapter to stop working. I have tried several of these and its the same issue. If the wire on the adapter bends a little it will stop working. Usually in 6 months to a year this adapter stops working. Given the price of this Apple product I expect much more, but this product is a ripoff.

This connector works great! Sometimes a large screen TV won't recognize the connector alone, but if I plug my iPhone/iPad charging cable into the adapter, it works great and actually charges my device while I'm using it. The best part - I can use the same device to play movies from my iPad directly onto my 55\" flat panel TV at home! All it takes is an HDMI cable.
